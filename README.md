Repository Organization
-----------------------

This is the repository for our front-end. It will contain a minimal development
webserver in Java, and the HTML, CSS, and Javascript needed for our UI.
Eventually it should contain the build scripts for our Phonegap builds.

Project Scope
-------------

This project is being created by a team of eight students at the University of
Florida for CEN3031, Introduction to Software Engineering. It will be developed
in three Scrum sprints over the course of the Spring 2013 semester.
