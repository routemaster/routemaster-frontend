  phone.
- View past routes, and the routes of your friends
- Earn points for walking efficient routes
- Earn points for exploring more area than your friends

Repository Organization
-----------------------

This is the repository for our front-end. It will contain a minimal development
webserver in Java, and the HTML, CSS, and Javascript needed for our UI.
Eventually it should contain the build scripts for our Phonegap builds.

Building the Project
--------------------

1.  Install `nodejs`. There's [information about how to do this on the node
    wiki][node wiki].
2.  Install `sass`. The [sass website has information on how to do this][sass
    website].
3.  Install the `grunt` command-line tool: `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`.
4.  Install all local dependencies: `npm install`
5.  Compile by simply running: `grunt`
